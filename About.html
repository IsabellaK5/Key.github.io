                <div class="School-Info">
                    <p>I am a current Sophomore at Maryville University studying Computer Science with an emphasis in User 
                    Experience and a minor in Communications! I chose this career because it's the perfect crossroad combining
                    technical knowledge of coding with creative aspects of art and design.</p>

                <p>I decided to create this website as a way to further improve my coding skills as well as showcase 
                some of the awesome projects I've been working on! Click <a href="Website About.html">here</a> to learn more.</p>

                <p>I was recently introduced to the Laws of UX and I'd have to say my favorite one is the Aesthetic-Usability Effect! 
                    This law states users are happier if what they are using looks aesthetically pleasing. I strive to show this in my own 
                    designs by focusing on the importance of typeface, color, and imagery. I want to focus on not only creating digital 
                    media that is easy to use, but also imaginative and exciting! Because where's the fun in something that's boring?</p>
