<!-- About Information -->
<div class = "School-Info">
    <p> I am a current Sophomore about Maryville University studying Computer Science with am emphasis in User 
        Experience and a minor in Communications! I chose this career because it's the perfect crossroad combining
         technical knowledge of coding with creative aspects of art and design.

}
</style>

<div class = "Why-Info">
    <p> I decided to create this website as a way to further improve my coding skills as well as showcase 
        some of the awesome projects I've been working on! Click <a href = "Website About.html"> here </a> to learn more.

<div class = "Law-Info">
    I was recently introduced to the Laws of UX and I'd have to say my favorite one is the Aesthetic-Usability Effect! This 
    law states users are happier if what they are using looks aesthetically pleasing. I strive to show this in my own 
    designs by focusing on the importance of typeface, color, and imagery. I want to focus on not only creating digital 
    media that is easy to use, but also imaginative and exciting! Because where's the fun in something that's boring?

<div class = "Free-Time">
    <p> I'm constantly inspired by the world around me! When I'm not designing websites in my free time, you can find
        me reading, hiking, or drawing!
